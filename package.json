It is better to define a value to a custom / more user-friendly message*).\n  ![ios: request when in use authorization](./images/plistRequireAlwaysUseAutorization.png)\n\n\n- **use background mode** check [this documentation](./BACKGROUND_MODES.md)\n\n### 3.b configuration specific to Android\n\nNothing (lucky Android :smile:).\n\nJust don't forget to activate\n- Bluetooth service (*all android version*)\n- Location service (*android < 7: beacon detection won't work on android 6 if location service is off*)\n\n## 4 usage\n\n>NOTE: If simple examples below don't help you as much as you wanted, [check detailed documentation depending on use-case + code samples here](https://github.com/MacKentoch/react-native-beacons-manager/tree/master/examples/samples#detailed-documentation--sample-code)\n\n### 4.a iOS\n\n#### Simple example\n\n```javascript\nimport { DeviceEventEmitter } from 'react-native'\nimport Beacons from 'react-native-beacons-manager'\n\n// Define a region which can be identifier + uuid,\n// identifier + uuid + major or identifier + uuid + major + minor\n// (minor and major properties are numbers)\nconst region = {\n    identifier: 'Estimotes',\n    uuid: 'B9407F30-F5F8-466E-AFF9-25556B57FE6D'\n};\n\n// Request for authorization while the app is open\nBeacons.requestWhenInUseAuthorization();\n\nBeacons.startMonitoringForRegion(region);\nBeacons.startRangingBeaconsInRegion(region);\n\nBeacons.startUpdatingLocation();\n\n// Listen for beacon changes\nconst subscription = DeviceEventEmitter.addListener(\n  'beaconsDidRange',\n  (data) => {\n    // data.region - The current region\n    // data.region.identifier\n    // data.region.uuid\n\n    // data.beacons - Array of all beacons inside a region\n    //  in the following structure:\n    //    .uuid\n    //    .major - The major version of a beacon\n    //    .minor - The minor version of a beacon\n    //    .rssi - Signal strength: RSSI value (between -100 and 0)\n    //    .proximity - Proximity value, can either be \"unknown\", \"far\", \"near\" or \"immediate\"\n    //    .accuracy - The accuracy of a beacon\n  }\n);\n```\n\n#### API\n\n| Method                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|:----------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **requestWhenInUseAuthorization** | This method should be called before anything else is called. It handles to request the use of beacons while the application is open. If the application is in the background, you will not get a signal from beacons. Either this method or `Beacons.requestAlwaysAuthorization` needs to be called to receive data from beacons.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| **requestAlwaysAuthorization**    | This method should be called before anything else is called. It handles to request the use of beacons while the application is open or in the background. Either this method or `Beacons.requestWhenInUseAuthorization` needs to be called to receive data from beacons.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| **getAuthorizationStatus**        | This methods gets the current authorization status. While this methods provides a callback, it is not executed asynchronously. The values `authorizedAlways` and `authorizedWhenInUse` correspond to the methods `requestWhenInUseAuthorization` and `requestAlwaysAuthorization` respectively.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| **startMonitoringForRegion**      | When starting monitoring for beacons, we need to define a region as the parameter. The `region` is an object, which needs to have at least two values: `identifier` and `uuid`. Additionally, it can also have a `major`, `minor` version or both. Make sure to not re-use the same identifier. In that case, we won't get the data for the beacons. The corresponding events are `regionDidEnter` and `regionDidExit`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| **startRangingBeaconsInRegion**   | When ranging for beacons, we need to define a `region` as the parameter. The `region` is an object, which needs to have at least two values: `identifier` and `uuid`. Additionally, it can also have a `major`, `minor` version or both. Make sure to not re-use the same identifier. In that case, we won't get the data for the beacons. The corresponding events are `beaconsDidRange`. The event will fire in every interval the beacon sends a signal, which is one second in most cases. If we are monitoring and ranging for beacons, it is best to first call `startMonitoringForRegion` and then call `startRangingBeaconsInRegion`. |\n| **startUpdatingLocation**         | This call is needed for monitoring beacons and gets the initial position of the device.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| **stopUpdatingLocation**          | This method should be called when you don't need to receive location-based information and want to save battery power.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| **shouldDropEmptyRanges**         | Call this method to stop sending the `beaconsDidRange` event when the beacon list is empty.

If you have three regions you get three events every second (which is the default interval beacons send their signal). When we take a closer look at the parameter of the callback, we get information on both the region and the beacons.                                 |\n| **regionDidEnter**               | If the device entered a region, `regionDidEnter` is being called. Inside the callback the parameter we can use returns an object with a property `region` that contains the `region` identifier value as a string. Additionally, we get the UUID of the region through its `uuid` property.                                                     |\n| **regionDidExit**                | In the same `regionDidEnter` is called if the device entered a region, `regionDidExit` will be called if the device exited a region and we can't get any signal from any of the beacons inside the region.
